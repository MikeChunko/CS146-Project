# CS146-Project

This website was created in the Fall 2018 semester at Stevens Institute for CS 146. 
The website is designed to solve the issue college students have with finding affordable and nutrtitious food. It hopes to inform college students on how to cook the best, cheapest, and most convenient meals. 
Additionally, it hopes to prevent the nation-wide phenomenon known as the freshman 15, by providing proper daily nutrition information. 
This website is founded on the idea that the more people are informed about food, the healthier their food choices will be. 
In addition, as Stevens students, we have added information on all there is to know about food at Stevens.
