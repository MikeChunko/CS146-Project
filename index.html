    <h2>Team Members: Cassie Ball, Mike Chunko, Andrea Meyer, Sid Patel, Ryan Qin</h2>
    <p>As a part of a new initiative at Stevens, this website is designed to solve the issue students at Stevens have with food. It hopes to inform students on how to cook the best, cheapest, and most convenient meals. The team acknowledges the nation-wide phenomenon known as the freshman 15; in order to save incoming Stevens students from this tendency, the website aims to provide proper nutrition information and encourages healthy food choices. This website is founded on the idea that as more students are informed about food, the healthier their food choices will be.  </p>

            <h2>Succeed</h2>
            <p>We ultimately seek to help students succeed in their educational pursuit at Stevens Institute of Technology. We believe that eating healthy leads to a general sense of wellbeing, which in turn helps students become successful in aspects such as education, extracirrculars, and leadership.</p>

            <h2>Educate</h2>
            <p>This platform serves as a hub of information for Stevens' students to use when needed. We not only hope to educate students about healthy eating, but also about the food options they have at Stevens.</p>

            <h2>Promote Health</h2>
            <p>Healthy choices form a buleprint for a student's overall health. We hope to foster these healthy choices and encourage students to take one step forward towards bettering themselves.
